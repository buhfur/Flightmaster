Notes while working on this project to define what it is 
----


# Implementations of the project: 

1. CLI tool that downloads addons from my hosted IPFS node 
2. Scrape legacy-wow.com for all the github links to the addons 
and have the user download addons from that selection of addons




[x] - scrape vanilla addons for all addon links 
[x] - Scrape legacy-wow.com for all href's with "github.com" in them
[x] - script to look at file of links and get their github download links 
[] -

Write script to upload them all to the IPFS node and pin the hashes ?



----

Some updates , I have now been able to scrape all the addons off the vanilla addons
website , now time to decide what to do with this data. I'm thinking of :

[] - checking every page on this list for a "github" link 
[] - cloning the repo in the link to my IPFS node
