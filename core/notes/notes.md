Notes while working on this project to define what it is 
----


# Implementations of the project: 

1. CLI tool that downloads addons from my hosted IPFS node 
2. Scrape legacy-wow.com for all the github links to the addons 
and have the user download addons from that selection of addons




- Scrape legacy-wow.com for all href's with "github.com" in them
- compile them all in a document and search by name
